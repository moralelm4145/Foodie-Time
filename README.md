<h1>Breakfast</h1>

<h2><ul><li>Beeps 50's Diner</li></ul></h2>
<p>Not only does this cute diner have a history that dates back to circa 1956, but it also has so much variety in food choices,
  you'll have no need to look anywhere else!</p>
<p>Beeps goes from traditional malts and pancakes to 13 inch subs filled with grilled chicken, steak, or even veggies!
 Yep, that's right. 13 inches. But wait! There's more! They also carry deliciously crispy and gooey mozzarella sticks and
give you pancakes roughly the size of your head. Not only is this little diner delicious, but you won't be complaining
about not getting your money's worth here because Beeps makes sure you leave with a full stomach with still enough
on your plate to take home too!</p>
<p>Now that we've discussed the food, let's talk atmosphere. The moment you set foot in Beeps you are greeted by
not only friendly staff, but by loud oldies (and I mean oldies!) music. While you're listening to Elvis and the Beach Boys
singing their tunes in the background, you'll be distracted by every inch of wall covered in movie posters and records
as well as portraits and pictures ranging from Marilyn Monroe and James Dean, to even the Adams Family.</p>
<p>So while you're in the San Fernando Valley, I highly recommend you put Beeps on your list of Must Visits!</p>

<h2><ul><li>The Crepe Cafe</li></ul></h2>
<p>If you've never had Crepes before, you'll flip if you let this adorable french themed cafe become your first experience!
<br /> Or if you're a crepe lover like me, this should definitely land on your Foodie Time bucket list!</p>
<p>With great crepes comes great responsibility! The Crepe Cafe is located at the heart of Universal City Walk.
With all the sights to take in, one could miss this place out of all the other little restaurants located in this magical
place. But what makes this little cafe stand out is not only the irresistable smell of sweet crepes as you walk by but
also the chef's show they provide you through their glass window is sure to catch the attention of every pair of eyes
that walks by! They make crepes of all kinds whether you need a traditional banana strawberry nutella crepe with fresh whipped
cream and a scoop of icecream to top it off.. or even a Florentine Crepe with spinach, red onion, and some warm cheddar cheese
garnished with some feta as well.. But they don't stop at just crepes, oooh no.
They come ready with a stack of cards full of foodie cravings you didn't expect. Did anyone say... Funnel Fries for
my carnival lovers??? How about..
garlic fries! No? Then you'll have to save the excitment for eating the infamous.. CARNE ASADA FRIES! Ooh yesss and they're
locked and loaded. </p>
<p>For all crepe lovers and crepe virgins; allow me to introduce you, once again, to this little one-stop-shop known as
The Crepe Cafe. Where you can find answers to both your hunger and your sweet tooth!</p>
